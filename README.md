# pqm-server

TODO List

1. Set Accounts' and IPs' reputation
2. Cross device sync as an optional feature (That would need the messages to persist on our servers. That isn't the default case.)
3. Implement a TLS layer preferably using PQ SSL.
4. Public Key -> QR Code-like representation that is really easy for a person to remember.
5. Something to prevent people from creating multiple accounts without harming their privacy.
6. DDoS prevention.
7. Setting custom usage limits as per plans.
8. Looks into Message Size correlation attacks. Look into padding based attacks.
9. During Singup, do check if the user's public keys already exist in our key repository or not.
10. Ask the user if he wants to recieve mails from unknown users or not -> create a list of email addresses from which he does want to recieve mails from.
11. Look into bot detection seriously!
