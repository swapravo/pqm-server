Server Log:

Status:
    Accepts incoming connections, checks if they exist
        in a list of blocked users, ACCEPTS them nevertheless (dev feature),
    Decrypts asymmetric requests, validates timestamps, nonces, datatypes
        and data fields.
    Entertains username availability checks and signup requests.

TODO:
    replace shell=True
    REPORT ABNORMAL ERRORS/EXITS preferably using if err:...
    create a block/spam list curated for eacn user.
    we're feeding dmz data to msgpack...! that bugs me!
    Make a requirements.txt
    Setup and secure a Postgres backend
    Write a script for installing and setting up the server its dependencies
    Should we replace the request/response codes with the string equivalents
        of the same?
    Find a way to kill processes once they are done processing a request
    Find a better way to block connections:
        Currently, we use IPs / IP+port.
        Blocking IPs would block a lot of people, in case of
            a shared network like an office.
        Blocking IP+port would create conflicts with other
            users on the same network in case the client
            starts up on the same port
    Find a robust way to remove keys that are written to the
        server's keyring: -> should we modify Codecrypt?
      Need to keep logs about user activity!
