Server Log:

Status:
    Accepts incoming connections, checks if they exist
        in a list of blocked users, ACCEPTS them nevertheless (dev feature),
    Decrypts asymmetric requests, validates timestamps, nonces, datatypes
        and data fields.
    Entertains username availability checks and signup requests.

TODO:
    Check for race conditions on shared resources: databases, Codecrypt, keyring
    Block IP for request floods and block usernames for sending mangled requests
    replace shell=True
    REPORT ABNORMAL ERRORS/EXITS preferably using if err:...
    create a block/spam list curated for eacn user.
    we're feeding dmz data to msgpack...! that bugs me!
    Make a requirements.txt
    Setup and secure a Postgres backend
    Write a script for installing and setting up the server its dependencies
    Should we replace the request/response codes with the string equivalents
        of the same?
    Find a way to kill processes once they are done processing a request
    Find a better way to block connections:
        Currently, we use IPs / IP+port.
        Blocking IPs would block a lot of people, in case of
            a shared network like an office.
        Blocking IP+port would create conflicts with other
            users on the same network in case the client
            starts up on the same port
    Find a robust way to remove keys that are written to the
        server's keyring: -> should we modify Codecrypt?
    Need to keep logs about user activity!
    When the remaining signature count starts to get low,
      Codecrypt will print warning messages. In that case, users
      are advised to generate and certify new keys.
